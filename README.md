# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Objective
The goal of this project is to understand, analyze, and represent the dataset to predict the price of a car using a well-trained machine learning model.

# Steps
1. Loading the Dataset -
The required dataset is uploaded from Kaggle.
Dataset Link

2. Basic Understanding of the Data -
Understand the basic information regarding the dataset to ensure proper training of the model.
This includes examining the features, target variable, and data types.

3. Data Cleaning -
Fill in missing values.
Drop unnecessary columns.
Ensure consistency across all attributes.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) -
Perform statistical analysis on the data.
Visualize the data to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Identify key features that influence car prices.

5. Training the Model - 
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Train the model using appropriate machine learning algorithms.

6. Testing the Model -
Test the model on the 20% testing dataset.
Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

7. Evaluating the Model -
Check the R² score of the model on both training and testing data.
Training data R² score: 60.92%
Testing data R² score: 66.15%

# Outcome
The model successfully predicts car prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy, as indicated by the R² scores.
